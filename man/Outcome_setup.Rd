\title{Build the outcome plan (\code{MR_df}) by mapping phenotypes to GWAS manifests}
\usage{
Outcome_setup(sex, ancestry)
}
\arguments{
\item{sex}{Character. One of \code{"both"}, \code{"male"}, or \code{"female"}.}

\item{ancestry}{Character ancestry code. If \code{sex} is \code{"male"} or
\code{"female"}, this must be \code{"EUR"}.}
}
\value{
A tibble \code{MR_df} combining the phenotype data with GWAS manifest
metadata. The column \code{ARD_selected} flags age-related diseases.
}
\description{
Selects the appropriate phenotype table based on \code{sex}, logs counts at the
ICD-10 and cause levels, then maps the \code{ICD10_explo} column to the relevant
GWAS manifest. The table contains age-related disease (ARD) and non-ARD
phenotypes; \code{ARD_selected} marks the ARD subset. Pan-UKB is used when
\code{sex == "both"}; otherwise Neale manifests are consulted. Phenotypes with no
available GWAS are dropped and duplicated ICD10 codes are resolved using
\code{ARD_selected} as a tiebreaker.
